            <h5>
                Neymar injury: Brazil forward ruled out of second World Cup group stage game with ankle injury
            </h5>
            <p>
                Neymar will miss Brazil's second World Cup match, but will remain with the squad undergoing treatment
                for his
                ankle injury, the team doctor said Friday.
                Rodrigo Lasmar said tests conducted on his right ankle showed that Neymar has a ligament injury and will
                not be
                fit to play against Switzerland on Monday.
                "It's important to remain calm, an evaluation will be conducted daily so we can have more information
                and take
                the most appropriate decisions," Lasmar said, adding that "the goal is to have him recover" in time to
                still
                play in the tournament.
                Lasmar did not give a timetable for Neymar's recovery. He said the situation of defender Danilo, who has
                a left
                ankle injury, was similar to Neymar's and he would also miss the game against Switzerland.
                Neymar was receiving treatment at the team's hotel Friday after getting injured in the 2-0 win against
                Serbia in
                Brazil's opener.
                The Paris Saint-Germain striker sprained his ankle in the second half of a bruising match against Serbia
                on
                Thursday. He was in tears while sitting on the bench with ice around his ankle and limped off the field
                on his
                way to the locker room.
                "Difficult game, but it was important to win," Neymar said on his social media accounts not long after
                he left
                Lusail Stadium without talking to the media. "Congratulations team, first step taken. Six more to go."
                In an Instagram story after the match, Neymar posted a text that mentioned the need to "have faith."
                "It's about believing that everything will be OK despite the chaos. It's the certainty that the best is
                yet to
                come. It's understanding that everything has its own timing," the text said.
                Brazil coach Tite had already expressed optimism about Neymar's condition. "You can be sure that Neymar
                will
                still play in this World Cup," he said after the match. "I'm certain about that."
                Neymar was substituted in the 79th minute, about 10 minutes after hurting his ankle while being tackled
                by
                Serbia defender Nikola Milenkovic.
                Neymar had already been tackled many times before during the match, and was seen grimacing and limping a
                few
                other occasions. He was fouled nine times, the most of all World Cup players after the first round of
                matches in
                the group stage.
                "We'll remain upbeat, it's the characteristic of this team," Brazil goalkeeper Alisson said. "These
                adverse
                circumstances will only make the group stronger."
                The five-time world champions end their group-stage campaign against Cameroon on Friday, December 2.
                Brazil
                leads Group G along with Switzerland, who opened with a win against Cameroon.
                If Neymar can't play, his replacement would likely be Rodrygo, who came in as a second-half substitute
                against
                Serbia on Thursday.
                The 30-year-old Neymar was also hurt at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, when his tournament ended with a
                back
                injury in the quarter-finals against Colombia. He had to be taken off the field on a stretcher, and
                Brazil ended
                up losing to Germany 7-1 in the semi-finals.
                Neymar's right foot has caused him problems in the past, being among the series of injuries he suffered
                since
                the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Another right ankle sprain led him to miss the 2019 Copa America that
                Brazil won.

                Neymar has yet to win a major title with the national team. He helped the Selecao win the 2013
                Confederations
                Cup and its first Olympic gold medal at the 2016 Rio Games.

                With 75 goals for the national team, he is two shy of Pele's scoring record.

            <h3>
                Brothers held for running portals containing personal data of Maharashtra, Delhi & Gujarat residents
            </h3>
            <p>The Mumbai Police Crime Branch, following a two-month operation, arrested two Commerce graduates on
                Thursday
                for allegedly running portals that provided personal data of residents of Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat
                at a
                price.
                The data was sold mainly to loan recovery agents at a monthly subscription of Rs 2,000, a half-year
                subscription
                of Rs 12,000 and an annual subscription of Rs 24,000, a police officer said.
                The officer added that after getting access to the website, just by feeding in the person’s name in the
                search
                option, the subscriber could get details like current and former cellphone numbers, Aadhaar card number,
                address, date of birth and phone numbers of family members, among other details.
                A senior officer identified the two Mulund-based siblings as Rahul Eligati (28) and Nikhil Eligati (25).
                “Nikhil
                has in the past worked as a loan recovery agent, through which he came to know about the source from
                where data
                of loan defaulters was obtained by companies,” the officer added.
                “Once one enters a name, all the data linked to the person that he has not even shared with others, pops
                up,
                including personal numbers, Aadhaar card data, address, date of birth and numbers of other family
                members,” said
                an officer.
                The police said that so far, there is no clarity on how the accused managed to get access to such a
                sensitive
                database.

                The police said that the brothers were careful with whom they shared the database. “Only if someone
                approached
                them through a reference, did they take money and shared the ID and password of the websites. They were
                operating the websites as a start-up and one could approach them only if you came through a reference,”
                the
                officer said.
                “We are questioning the two to find out if they had hacked some government website or if an insider at
                such
                places parted with sensitive data. Another line of investigation is whether the accused purchased this
                data from
                the dark net where sometimes personal data is dumped by cyber criminals and sold for a price,” the
                officer added

            <h3>
                This sleep-inducing trick will ensure you sleep like a baby tonight
            </h3>
            <p>After a long, tiring day, what is the one thing you really look forward to? Sleep, most likely — isn’t
                it? But
                there are many people who struggle with a good night’s sleep even after hitting the bed on time and
                spend many
                hours just tossing and turning. As such, is there any remedy (or trick) that can help those who find it
                challenging to catch some shuteye? Turns out, there is! And that is exactly what Harshvardhan Saraf,
                co-founder
                of Satvic Movement, recently shared on Instagram.

                “For me, a hot foot bath is just the right sleep inducer,” he captioned the video in which he can be
                seen
                soaking his feet in warm water. “I love how it helps me relax even mentally at the end of a packed
                working day,
                and I just return to slowness! Slowness in the mind and in my breathing,” he added.
                “The water should be only hot enough for you to comfortably soak your feet. Nothing extreme!” he
                mentioned.
                According to a 2013-study published in the International Journal of Nursing Studies, lower core
                temperature
                coupled with a higher distal (hands and feet) temperature before sleep is associated with shorter sleep
                latency
                and better sleep quality. A warm footbath is thought to facilitate heat dissipation to improve sleep
                outcomes.
                Adding, Deepti Khatuja, head clinical nutritionist, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon
                explained that
                soaking feet in water helps to bring down the body temperature, which helps send a signal to the brain
                to
                release the hormone melatonin — that initiates sleep. “Additionally, soaking the feet in warm water with
                salt
                helps in relieving muscle cramps and, in turn, fatigue. This helps in better sleep,” she told
                According to Dr Rohini Patil, MBBS, Nutritionist and CEO of Nutracy Lifestyle, soaking one’s feet in
                warm water
                right before sleep also helps improve heart rate, breathing, and calms down the body. “It stimulates
                blood
                circulation, which helps in sleeping faster and better,” she shared.
                So, do you plan to try this trick night? Let us know if it worked for you!

            <h3>
                Rishi Sunak Plans Curbs On Foreign Students To Control Migration: Report
            </h3>
            <p>UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will be considering "all options", including reducing the number of foreign
                students, in his bid to bring down the rising net migration in the United Kingdom, according to a report
                by the
                BBC.
                Mr Sunak will be looking into imposing curbs on foreign students pursuing so-called "low quality"
                degrees and
                bringing in dependents, the report said, quoting a Downing Street spokesperson. The spokesperson did
                not,
                however, define what is a "low quality" degree.
                The UK government's concerns for rising migration have been set off by the latest Office for National
                Statistics
                (ONS) figures this week that showed a huge jump in the number of migrants. Net migration to the UK rose
                from
                173,000 in 2021, to 504,000 this year - an increase of 331,000.
                International students, especially Indians who took over the Chinese for the first time to make up the
                majority
                of student visas, were a big contributor to this spike.
                "We're considering all options to make sure the immigration system is delivering. The prime minister is
                fully
                committed to bringing overall numbers down," Mr Sunak's spokesman had said on Friday.
                But controlling the number of migrants by restricting the number of foreign students presents a tricky
                task.
                British universities lean on higher fees from international students to offset the money, they lose by
                charging
                British students a lower fee, with some universities even risking bankruptcy if restrictions were
                imposed on
                so-called low-quality degrees, the report said.
                An Indian community-led students' organisation on Friday urged the government to remove international
                students
                from the country's immigration statistics. "Students who are in the UK temporarily, should not be
                counted as
                migrants. International students, of which Indians are the biggest cohort, bring a net revenue of GBP 30
                billion
                into the British economy," said Sanam Arora, Chair of National Indian Students and Alumni Union (NISAU)
                UK.
                Post a commentThe Sunak government has promised to cut net migration in the UK with India-origin Home
                Secretary
                Suella Braverman earlier complaining about Indian students overstaying in the country. "I have concerns
                about
                having an open borders migration policy with India because I don't think that's what people voted for
                with
                Brexit. Look at migration in this country - the largest group of people who overstay are Indian
                migrants," she
                had said.
