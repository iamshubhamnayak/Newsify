            <h5>
                Brothers held for running portals containing personal data of Maharashtra, Delhi & Gujarat residents
            </h5>
            <p>The Mumbai Police Crime Branch, following a two-month operation, arrested two Commerce graduates on
                Thursday
                for allegedly running portals that provided personal data of residents of Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat
                at a
                price.
                The data was sold mainly to loan recovery agents at a monthly subscription of Rs 2,000, a half-year
                subscription
                of Rs 12,000 and an annual subscription of Rs 24,000, a police officer said.
                The officer added that after getting access to the website, just by feeding in the person’s name in the
                search
                option, the subscriber could get details like current and former cellphone numbers, Aadhaar card number,
                address, date of birth and phone numbers of family members, among other details.
                A senior officer identified the two Mulund-based siblings as Rahul Eligati (28) and Nikhil Eligati (25).
                “Nikhil
                has in the past worked as a loan recovery agent, through which he came to know about the source from
                where data
                of loan defaulters was obtained by companies,” the officer added.
                “Once one enters a name, all the data linked to the person that he has not even shared with others, pops
                up,
                including personal numbers, Aadhaar card data, address, date of birth and numbers of other family
                members,” said
                an officer.
                The police said that so far, there is no clarity on how the accused managed to get access to such a
                sensitive
                database.

                The police said that the brothers were careful with whom they shared the database. “Only if someone
                approached
                them through a reference, did they take money and shared the ID and password of the websites. They were
                operating the websites as a start-up and one could approach them only if you came through a reference,”
                the
                officer said.
                “We are questioning the two to find out if they had hacked some government website or if an insider at
                such
                places parted with sensitive data. Another line of investigation is whether the accused purchased this
                data from
                the dark net where sometimes personal data is dumped by cyber criminals and sold for a price,” the
                officer added
