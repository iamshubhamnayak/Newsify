                This sleep-inducing trick will ensure you sleep like a baby tonight
            </h3>
            <p>After a long, tiring day, what is the one thing you really look forward to? Sleep, most likely — isn’t
                it? But
                there are many people who struggle with a good night’s sleep even after hitting the bed on time and
                spend many
                hours just tossing and turning. As such, is there any remedy (or trick) that can help those who find it
                challenging to catch some shuteye? Turns out, there is! And that is exactly what Harshvardhan Saraf,
                co-founder
                of Satvic Movement, recently shared on Instagram.

                “For me, a hot foot bath is just the right sleep inducer,” he captioned the video in which he can be
                seen
                soaking his feet in warm water. “I love how it helps me relax even mentally at the end of a packed
                working day,
                and I just return to slowness! Slowness in the mind and in my breathing,” he added.
                “The water should be only hot enough for you to comfortably soak your feet. Nothing extreme!” he
                mentioned.
                According to a 2013-study published in the International Journal of Nursing Studies, lower core
                temperature
                coupled with a higher distal (hands and feet) temperature before sleep is associated with shorter sleep
                latency
                and better sleep quality. A warm footbath is thought to facilitate heat dissipation to improve sleep
                outcomes.
                Adding, Deepti Khatuja, head clinical nutritionist, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon
                explained that
                soaking feet in water helps to bring down the body temperature, which helps send a signal to the brain
                to
                release the hormone melatonin — that initiates sleep. “Additionally, soaking the feet in warm water with
                salt
                helps in relieving muscle cramps and, in turn, fatigue. This helps in better sleep,” she told
                According to Dr Rohini Patil, MBBS, Nutritionist and CEO of Nutracy Lifestyle, soaking one’s feet in
                warm water
                right before sleep also helps improve heart rate, breathing, and calms down the body. “It stimulates
                blood
                circulation, which helps in sleeping faster and better,” she shared.
                So, do you plan to try this trick night? Let us know if it worked for you!
