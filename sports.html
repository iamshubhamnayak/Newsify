                Neymar injury: Brazil forward ruled out of second World Cup group stage game with ankle injury
            </h5>
            <p>
                Neymar will miss Brazil's second World Cup match, but will remain with the squad undergoing treatment
                for his
                ankle injury, the team doctor said Friday.
                Rodrigo Lasmar said tests conducted on his right ankle showed that Neymar has a ligament injury and will
                not be
                fit to play against Switzerland on Monday.
                "It's important to remain calm, an evaluation will be conducted daily so we can have more information
                and take
                the most appropriate decisions," Lasmar said, adding that "the goal is to have him recover" in time to
                still
                play in the tournament.
                Lasmar did not give a timetable for Neymar's recovery. He said the situation of defender Danilo, who has
                a left
                ankle injury, was similar to Neymar's and he would also miss the game against Switzerland.
                Neymar was receiving treatment at the team's hotel Friday after getting injured in the 2-0 win against
                Serbia in
                Brazil's opener.
                The Paris Saint-Germain striker sprained his ankle in the second half of a bruising match against Serbia
                on
                Thursday. He was in tears while sitting on the bench with ice around his ankle and limped off the field
                on his
                way to the locker room.
                "Difficult game, but it was important to win," Neymar said on his social media accounts not long after
                he left
                Lusail Stadium without talking to the media. "Congratulations team, first step taken. Six more to go."
                In an Instagram story after the match, Neymar posted a text that mentioned the need to "have faith."
                "It's about believing that everything will be OK despite the chaos. It's the certainty that the best is
                yet to
                come. It's understanding that everything has its own timing," the text said.
                Brazil coach Tite had already expressed optimism about Neymar's condition. "You can be sure that Neymar
                will
                still play in this World Cup," he said after the match. "I'm certain about that."
                Neymar was substituted in the 79th minute, about 10 minutes after hurting his ankle while being tackled
                by
                Serbia defender Nikola Milenkovic.
                Neymar had already been tackled many times before during the match, and was seen grimacing and limping a
                few
                other occasions. He was fouled nine times, the most of all World Cup players after the first round of
                matches in
                the group stage.
                "We'll remain upbeat, it's the characteristic of this team," Brazil goalkeeper Alisson said. "These
                adverse
                circumstances will only make the group stronger."
                The five-time world champions end their group-stage campaign against Cameroon on Friday, December 2.
                Brazil
                leads Group G along with Switzerland, who opened with a win against Cameroon.
                If Neymar can't play, his replacement would likely be Rodrygo, who came in as a second-half substitute
                against
                Serbia on Thursday.
                The 30-year-old Neymar was also hurt at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, when his tournament ended with a
                back
                injury in the quarter-finals against Colombia. He had to be taken off the field on a stretcher, and
                Brazil ended
                up losing to Germany 7-1 in the semi-finals.
                Neymar's right foot has caused him problems in the past, being among the series of injuries he suffered
                since
                the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Another right ankle sprain led him to miss the 2019 Copa America that
                Brazil won.

                Neymar has yet to win a major title with the national team. He helped the Selecao win the 2013
                Confederations
                Cup and its first Olympic gold medal at the 2016 Rio Games.

                With 75 goals for the national team, he is two shy of Pele's scoring record.
